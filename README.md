# Stock-Duration-To-Come-Back-From-Crisis
I will generate a table of worst crisis faced by a Stock and time it took to recover to its initial price it had fallen from.

This will give an historical view of the kind of crises a company faced in its history, and the duration it took the company to recover from that crisis.


## RESULT
  **Company** : Boeing
